            <h2 class="text-center">History</h1>
            <p>Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. The Chinese competitive game cuju (translates to "kick ball") resembles modern association football. In this game,  players could use any part of the body apart from hands to kick a ball through an opening into a net. During the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established. 
                Perhaps even older cuju was Marn Gook, played by Aboriginal Australians and according to white emigrants in the 1800s a ball game primarily involving kicking although the rules are mostly unknown. The ball was made by encased leaves or roots.
                Other variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was made by shreds of leather filled with hair (the first documents of balls filled with air are from the 7th century). In the Ancient Rome, games with balls were not included in the entertainment on the big arenas (amphitheaters) but occurred in exercises in the military by the name of Harpastum. It was the Roman culture that would bring football to the British island (Britannica) although it is unclear to which degree the British people were influenced.
                In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; There are records that show it was played in the 17th century. The game was played on beaches with goals about a half-mile-wide and set one mile apart. Up to 500 people usually played Pasuckuakohowog at one time, while many games had up to 1000 players.

            <h2 class="text-center">The game evolves</h2>
            <p>Association football in itself does not have a classical history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century CE.
                The Cambridge rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863. Rules for example that a goalkeeper can only hold the ball for up to 6 seconds before a free kick is awarded were continually developed including formal footballing bodies such as FIFA.
                On 30th November 1872, the first international game was played between Scotland and England. From this point on, the game evolved quickly. Tournaments such as the world cup and the European Champions Cup (which would later become the champions league) were established in 1930 and 1955 respectively. Real Madrid is the most successful club with 13 wins in the UEFA champions league and Brazil has the most world cup titles at 5. The first men and womens world cup titles were won by Uruguay and the United States respectively.

            <h2 class="text-center">The modern game</h2>
            <p>Football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport. Over the course of the final, some 1.1 billion people tuned in to watch France take on Croatia.
                In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.
